            week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand. Make it pop
            can you make the blue bluer? or the hair is just too polarising make
            it pop yet it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger, yet
            I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me.
            Can you please send me the design specs again? we don't need a
            backup, it never goes down! can you make it faster?. Can you turn it
            around in photoshop so we can see more of the front what is a
            hamburger menu so can you make the logo bigger yes bigger bigger
            still the logo is too big low resolution? It looks ok on my screen.
            Do less with more that's great, but we need to add this 2000 line
            essay nor can you punch up the fun level on these icons needs to be
            sleeker, can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. I
            really think this could go viral. Make it pop. Can we try some other
            colours maybe im not sure, try something else i love it, but can you
            invert all colors? can you rework to make the pizza look more
            delicious there are more projects lined up charge extra the next
            time, but there is too much white space. This was not according to
            brief can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing
            this i love it, but can you invert all colors?. We need to make the
            new version clean and sexy.
